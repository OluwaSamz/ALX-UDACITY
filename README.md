## Dataset

> The dataset was provided in the classroom. Also can be downloaded <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1667420993229327&usg=AOvVaw1HDdoELjj2-uESTKIXRPJP">here</a> The dataset initially contained 183412 rows and 16 columns, I indentified and dropped the missing values, reducing the number of rows to 174952. I changed the datatype of some columns to their datatypes.


## Summary of Findings

> During exploration, I made some interesting findings;
- 90.53% of users are subscribers and 9.47% are regular customers.
- The users were most male, taking up 74.59% of the gender space.
- Bikes are used more during the 8th and 17th hour of the day which is when most people go to and come off work, respectively.
- Most trips are made on Tuesdays and Thursdays and less trips are made on saturdays and sundays.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the frequencies of rides per day of week, hour, and user type, without considering any other variable. Then i combined day of week, hour, and user type in a plot to show how they interact.
